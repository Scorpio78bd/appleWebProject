        <p id="ev">Every child is born full of creativity. Nurturing it is one of the most important things<br/>educators do. Creativity makes your students better communicators and problem<br/>solvers. It prepares them to thrive in today’s world — and to shape tomorrow’s. For<br/>40 years, Apple has helped teachers unleash the creative potential in every<br/>student. And today, we do that in more ways than ever. Not only with powerful<br/>products, but also with tools, inspiration, and curricula to help you create magical<br/>learning experiences.</p>

      <h4 id="te"><strong>Technology designed<br/>to be as limitless as a<br/>child's imagination.</strong></h4>

      <p id="tech"> Apple products put complete freedom of expression in the hands of every student who uses them. iPad is simple enough for anyone to master right from the start, and flexible enough to let students go wherever their ideas take them. Mac provides the power to pursue even the most ambitious projects. And with a full suite of Apple-designed apps made for creation, both iPad and Mac give students a canvas as limitless as their imaginations.</p>

    <p id="tools"> We’ve developed tools to make it easy for you to guide<br/>how your students use devices and apps in the<br/>classroom, and to provide valuable insight into each<br/>student’s progress. So you can focus on what’s most<br/>important: teaching.</p>

      <h4 id="curriculum"><strong>A new curriculum that<br/>brings creative<br/>expression to every<br/>subject.</strong></h4>

      <p id="subject"> When students have more ways to express ideas, it<br/>changes how they think. They see things they wouldn’t<br/>otherwise see and make connections they wouldn’t<br/>otherwise make. With this in mind, we’ve worked with<br/>educators to design a new curriculum that helps you<br/>give students the skills to communicate through<br/>drawing, photography, music, and filmmaking — and<br/>then fold these skills into every subject you teach. So<br/>your students can put math equations to music, bring<br/>an illustrator’s eye to social studies, and make scientific<br/>processes come alive on film.</p>

        <p id="coding"> Coding is essential to help students thrive in a future<br/>driven by technology. We created the comprehensive<br/>Everyone Can Code curriculum with lessons on iPad and<br/>Mac, teacher guides, and apps to make it easy to teach<br/>coding in your classroom. Because we believe coding<br/>isn’t extracurricular — it’s part of the core curriculum.</p>

And<br/>programs to help teachers learn from one another,<br/>professional learning resources to build skills and<br/>confidence with iPad and Mac, and initiatives to<br/>recognize pioneers in education. All to empower you to<br/>be the best teacher you can be.</p>
